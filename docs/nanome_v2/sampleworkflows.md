# Sample Workflows and Usage

Below are some examples of workflows that can be accomplished in Nanome 2.0, including using MARA to open and prep structures.

## Opening from MARA

- Log into MARA and Nanome with the same account credentials.
- Create a new MARA chat.
- Prompt MARA to load a structure of your choice and MARA will render the structure in the Molstar Visualizer.
    - Example Prompt: "Load 67o" --> loads in Molstar viewer panel. 
- Click the button to "Open in XR", and a message will appear in MARA.
- Go to the Nanome app in your XR headset - the structure will be there as a new workspace named after the chat.

Note: The workspace will be set to ‘private’ so it cannot be shared.

Limitations: Each ‘open in headset’ from MARA will create a new workspace. Representations might not be exact between Molstar and Nanome. In those cases, our team is happy to help. Please reach out to us at support@nanome.ai to help us build solutions for representations.

## Sharing Workspace

- Open Collaboration and click ‘Permissions’. There are two main methods to do this:
    - Set the workspace code from ‘Private’ to ‘Viewer’ or ‘Editor’ depending on your needs, then tell your colleagues the code.
    - Invite a user directly by email if they have a Nanome account. (This must be an exact email match, there is no auto-completion.)
- Each user that joins with the code or was added via email will appear in the workspace list. 
    - Each user permission can be individually managed (including setting to none).

## Displaying Interactions Between Structures

- Make sure your structures show up as entries in the main section of the Application Menu.
- Find one of the entries, then click on the '3 dots' button to the right of the entry name.
- Select 'Add inter-entry interactions' from the pop-up menu, then choose the other entry you want to view and click 'Run'.

## Aligning Proteins in XR

- Make sure your proteins show up as entries in the main section of the Application Menu.
- Select one protein in the entry list, then click on the 'align' button to the right of the entry name.
- In the pop-up menu, select the protein you want to align with, then click 'Align'.
